Add the GameManager prefab to your game scene for testing.

You can change the vlues to whatever you want it will be deleted at runtime for the main game when run from the menu.

The GameManager will handle the pause menu and will display the player's global score on the pause menu.

CODE:
	Create a private variable:
	GameManager gm;

	On Awake do this:
	gm = GameObject.Find("GameManager").GetComponent<GameManager>();

	Whenever you want to score points do this:
	gm.ScorePoints(GameManager.games.YOURGAMEENUMNAME, 1f);

	If your game has a fail-state and needs to be reloaded do this (please don't use SceneManagment):
	RestartThisGame();
